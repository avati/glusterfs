How to achieve each of the below feature: (here, '@@@' is the delimiter string through which snapshot command is understood by posix layer)


* Taking Snapshot:

# ln filename filename@@@snap-name
for success: ret = -1; errno = EBUSY;
 
* Clone:
  ->  Clone of a file (file which already has snapshots)

# ln filename another-filename
for success: ret = -1; errno = EBUSY;
 
  ->  Clone of a snapshot

# ln filename@@@snap-name another-filename
for success: ret = -1; errno = EBUSY;

 
* Restore: This can be achieved by two or three steps as per the need.
  -> step 1: rename the file to temp.file

# mv filename temp.filename
 
  -> step 2: clone the snapshot from which we want to restore to actual filename

# ln temp.filename@@@snap-name filename
for success: ret = -1; errno = EBUSY;
 
  -> step 3: (optional) delete the temp.file

 # rm temp.filename
 


* Delete the snapshot: (not complete as per specification, but for user, its complete).

# rm filename@@@snap-name
 

* List snapshots
 
# ls -l filename@@@list
 

* Access (or read() ) particular snapshot

# cat filename@@@snap-name


 
* Rename a snapshot 

# mv filename@@@snap-name1 filename@@@snap-name2
